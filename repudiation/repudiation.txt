- Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version is better at preventing repudiation than the insecure version.
Sufficient logging of user information and activity on the server allows for program administrators to track malicious activity.  The insecure
version does not do this.
- What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?
Making the log immutable allows it to not be tampered with.  Regular log auditing is also a must to make sure nothing suspicious 
is found in the log that could be cause for alarm
