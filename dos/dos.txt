- Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.
The vulnerability is that certain inputs can crash the server.  The secure version uses a try/catch block
to avoid a crash.
- What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?
In dos attacks, rate limiting allows for attacks to be mitigated.  This alongside making sure that 
the server doesn't crash with error handling can make for a secure program.
