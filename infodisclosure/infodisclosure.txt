One can inject a NOSQL query into the uri with ease.  The program is not checking whether the given username is a valid
username or if it is a possible malicious query.  For that reason, it is trivial to NOSQL inject in the program.
On top of this, the user's information is not hashed.  Therefore it's just available for anyone to see in plaintext.

Once again, the answer is input sanitization.  By sanitizing the input one can ensure this does not happen.
