Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.
By not sanitizing the parameters, the malicious user can inject a query or other code into the endpoint and receive data without
permission.  The secure version prevents this by sanitizing the parameters to disallow malicious users from querying the database (in this case)
directly through the URL.

Which CIA property does tampering violate?
This violates Confidentiality and Integrity by not protecting sensitive data and allowing malicious code to be passed into the program.

What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate?
Data sanitization and encryption will disallow malicious users from gaining information they should be able to.
