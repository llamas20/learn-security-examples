The vulnerabilities originate from our lack of input sanitization.  We cannot trust the inputs given by users to not be malicious.
An attacker can use this vulnerability to inject malicious code into our program.

An attacker can input code rather than a normal input.  Because we do not sanitize the input, this code will be run by the program
without issue.  This is a massive problem.

secure.ts sanitizes the input with the function escapeHTML.  This function uses regex to take any possible HTML tags, escapes, and other
possibly problematic characters out of the input and creates a safe version which can be processed by the program.
